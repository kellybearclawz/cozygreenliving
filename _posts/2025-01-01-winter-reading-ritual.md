Winter invites us to slow down — to trade rushing for reflection,  
and noise for the quiet turning of pages.

Some of my favorite memories are of my dad sitting in front of the fireplace,  
reading his newspaper or book while listening to Chopin or Strauss  
as the snow fell outside the windows.

as the wind pushes icy snow across the glass.

He taught me that winter reading is magic.
