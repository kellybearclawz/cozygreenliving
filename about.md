# About the Cozy Book Club

Some of my favorite memories are of my dad sitting in front of the fireplace,  
reading the newspaper with Chopin playing softly as snow fell outside.

That quiet warmth shaped how I read — and how I build book club tools today.

The Cozy Book Club is a gentle space for anyone who wants to bring  
**intention, connection, and comfort** into their reading life.

I’m Kelly — maker of cozy kits, playlists, and seasonal reading rituals.  
I’m so glad you’re here.
